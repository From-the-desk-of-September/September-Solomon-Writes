# September‑Solomon‑Writes
**A static‑site landing page for my indie‑author paranormal & dark‑romance novels**September‑Solomon‑Writes is a lightweight, SEO‑friendly static website that showcases my upcoming paranormal romance novels, hosts a blog, and collects newsletter sign‑ups. Built with **Eleventy** (or whichever generator you use) and hosted for free on **GitHub Pages**, the site loads in under a second and works on any device.## Features

- **Landing page** with striking hero image and tagline
- **Book catalog** with cover art, blurbs, and purchase links
- **Blog** for updates, behind‑the‑scenes posts, and excerpts
- **Newsletter signup** integrated via MailerLite (or your service)
- **Responsive design** – looks great on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Fast loading** – under 1 s on Lighthouse performance audit

**Why?**  
- Provides a clear, reproducible workflow.  
- Reduces friction for anyone (including future you) who wants to test changes.

## 7️⃣ Deployment – Publishing to GitHub Pages

If you already have a GitHub Pages workflow, document it:

```markdown
## Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via the **GitHub Actions** workflow defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. Every push to the `main` branch triggers a build and publishes the `dist/` folder.

If you prefer manual deployment:

```bash
npm run build   # generates the static site in ./dist
git add dist
git commit -m "Deploy latest build"
git push origin main

**Why?**  
- Makes the publishing process transparent.  
- Encourages best practices (CI/CD) and helps troubleshoot deployment issues.

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b my-feature`).
3. Ensure the site builds locally (`npm run dev`).
4. Submit a PR targeting the `main` branch.
